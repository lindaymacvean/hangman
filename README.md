Description: CoderDojo Hangman
Developed by: Eric Thiebaut
Dependencies: HTML5 CSS JS Jquery Mobile

This project can be compiled using phonegap into a native application for android or iphone.

This branch belongs to Lindsay Macvean and is setup to be developed remotely once pulled, so it includes all dependencies. If you where going to make this live it would be suggested to change the links for jquery mobile etc to their official sources or use the Google cdn.
